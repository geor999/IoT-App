IoT-Arduino-Nodered  
This is the Arduino side of this project. It has the arduino code which is needed to send the humidity/temperature/heat-index information to the Node-red app through mqtt requests. The configuration of the arduino is as shown in the picture. There also needs to be a Led connected to pin 8 and the ground.
